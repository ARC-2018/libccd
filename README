libgjk is library for a collision detection between convex shapes.
libgjk implements variation on Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm and Expand
Polytope Algorithm (EPA).
libgjk also contains implementation of Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR,
a.k.a. XenoCollide) as described in Game Programming Gems 7.

Dependencies
-------------
This library is currently based only on standard libraries.
The only exception are testsuites that are built on top of CU
(cu.danfis.cz) library licensed under LGPL, however only testing depends on
it and libgjk library itself can be distributed without it.


License
--------
libgjk is licensed under OSI-approved 3-clause BSD License, text of license
is distributed along with source code in BSD-LICENSE file.
Each file should include license notice, the rest should be considered as
licensed under 3-clause BSD License.


Compile And Install
--------------------
Simply type 'make' and 'make install' in src/ directory.

Library libgjk is by default compiled in double precision of floating point
numbers - you can controll this by options USE_SINGLE/USE_DOUBLE, i.e.:
    $ make USE_SINGLE=yes
will compile library in single precision.

Installation directory can be changed by options PREFIX, INCLUDEDIR and
LIBDIR.

For more info type 'make help'.


Compile And Install Using Autotools
------------------------------------
libgjk also contains support for autotools:
1) Generate configure script etc.: $ ./bootstrap
2) Create new build/ directory: $ mkdir build && cd build
3) Run configure script: $ ../configure
4) Run make and make install: $ make && make install

configure script can change the way libgjk is compiled and installed, most
significant option is --enable-double-precision which enables double
precision (single is default in this case).


Usage
------
See gjk.h for public API.
In your application include <gjk/gjk.h>, setup gjk_t structure and run some
of functions (all functions are reentrant). Then link with libgjk.a.
